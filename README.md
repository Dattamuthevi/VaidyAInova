In era of AI-enhanced healthcare realignment, disease forecasting with accuracy and promptness is the key to proper patient care. This study proposes a novel ensemble-based system for disease prediction and prevention that combines CatBoost, XGBoost, TabNet, and LSTM for improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. The system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) for symptom analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide a clear understanding of the significance of the features in comparison to the obstacles posed by conventional black-box models. It encompasses numerical data that has been cleansed and scaled, and it pertains to multiple binary symptoms that are labelled with diseases, feature engineering, and imputation. The predictive performance of classification tasks is considerably enhanced to 98% by the Ensemble Learning Method, which employs a soft voting classifier. In order to verify its robustness, evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are implemented. Interpretability techniques are designed to increase the confidence in AI-powered diagnoses by emphasising the appropriate patterns of symptoms.
It works like a web-based application that provides users the facilities to enter the symptoms and returns immediate predictions as well as warning suggestions. Its design facilitates practical scalability, reliability, and usability in health environments. This paper links AI diagnosis with clinical utility in practical contexts, giving full clarity and decision support. It will continue on improving the model for use within resource-limited healthcare environments while incorporating deep learning techniques into the medical imaging space to detect total diseases.
